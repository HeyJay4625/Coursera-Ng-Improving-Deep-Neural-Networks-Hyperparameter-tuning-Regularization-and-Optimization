- Week 1 Practical aspects of Deep Learning
  - Recall that different types of initializations lead to different results
  - Recognize the importance of initialization in complex neural networks.
  - Recognize the difference between train/dev/test sets
  - Diagnose the bias and variance issues in your model
  - Learn when and how to use regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
  - Understand experimental issues in deep learning such as Vanishing or Exploding gradients and learn how to deal with them
  - Use gradient checking to verify the correctness of your backpropagation implementation
